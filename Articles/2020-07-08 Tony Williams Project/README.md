# Tony Williams Virtual Drummer Project

_Published: 2020-07-08_

Song tempo can be automated and tied to other variables through the master channel

## Tony Williams Project

1.  Rework the meat beat kit

    -   Try Loading up a version all in one sampler
    -   Split the sounds up and imrprove them
    -   Import the rests the of the cut samples into the drum machines
    -   Make sure to get a working piano roll to recreate the basic break.

2.  Put some Variations together for the kit

3.  Figure out a solid logical structure and routing for the russian dolls.

    -   Especially figure out how to route in cominig midi signals for a player.
        -   Figure out  how to package them all up

4.  Figure how to structure variations in play even just randomly through the player.
5.  Work on a control structure for creating variations both from the inside of the player and the outside (another musician)
6.  Try to generate 45 minutes of improv music from tony.

## Tips

The tony meaty beat, i should trigger the samples quantized, but have the attack come later.

1.  cut the sample length first
2.  flatten cmd + j
3.  quantize once flattened
4.  use beats for drum set

## Splitting drum tracks

If you get lucky enough to find a whole drum break:

The best thing to do is turn it into midi and then base your other samples around it.

1.  select the whole portion how ever many beats and bars
2.  cmd + e to split it off into it' own scene
3.  Loop it
4.  copy the loop warp it as far as you like, leave non percussive elongated parts attached to the attack portion that came before it.
5.  set warp markers before every percussive part
