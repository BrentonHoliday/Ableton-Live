## Drum Auditioner

Swap out up to 128 different drum patches out in your existing MIDI piano roll to find the one that works the best.

This is helpful when you've already contructed a scratch/ temporary beat or you have the whole beat finished, but you want to test different drum hits in place of existing ones.

### How to make a Drum Auditioner

Unfortunately, you can't save the chain presets without the samples loaded, si it will need to be constructed each time you want to audition a drum hit.

1.  Use a Instrument Rack. (not a drum rack)
2.  in the browser drag all samples that you're interested in testing into the racks
3.  Make sure the zone bars are set to all keys and velocities for each note.
4.  under chain set each sample to it;s own number. the fastest way to do this is:
    -   in the chain list (where the name displays) select all tracks except the top most one
    -   press right until you get to 1
    -   holding control deselect the top most selected One
    -   right right until you get to 2
    -   repeat
5.  map the chain number to a macro knob

### How to use a Drum Auditioner

On the track with your existing midi file turn the knob or use the arrow keys to audition new drum hits in their current place in the song.
