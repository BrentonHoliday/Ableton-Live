# Brent's Ableton Live `User Library` Folder

This repository is literally my Ableton Live `User Library` Folder. I've just gone through it and added a bunch of `README.md` files everywhere as well as some articles and notes to turn it into a website.

The _[Post Music Production](Articles/Post%20Music/README.md)_ is really the bit to check out. This library includes everything you need to get started.

## With love from Brent &lt;3

I sincerly hope that someone finds value in this and runs with it. Anyone who is interested in sharing their presets with me, gitize your library folder and send me a pull request. Let's create a massive, free open source resource library for all those to come after us.
