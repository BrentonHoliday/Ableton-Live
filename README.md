# Brent's Ableton Live `User Library` Folder

This repository is literally my Ableton Live `User Library` Folder. I've just gone through it and added a bunch of `README.md` files everywhere as well as some articles and notes to turn it into a website.

The _[Post Music Production](Articles/Post%20Music/README.md)_ is really the bit to check out. This library includes everything you need to get started.

## Table of Contents

-   [Todo](TODO.md) - The never ending list of things todo
-   [Articles](Articles/README.md) - A collection of articles and notes.
-   [Grooves](Grooves/README.md) - The folder where all your saved grooves live. Grooves are what add a human feel and timing to different clips / MIDI.

-   [Clips](Clips/README.md) - Clips of audio or midi files that you've consolidated or trimmed.

-   [Defaults](Defaults/README.md) Default actions that takes place when you do something. Things like:

    -   Audio to MIDI
    -   Dropping Samples
    -   Slicing

-   [Presets](Presets/README.md) - Packaged up racks for effects or instruments or now performance spaces and players both dead and alive!

    -   Instruments

        -   Electric Guitars
        -   synths

    -   Audio Effects

        -   Performance Space simulations
        -   Pedalboards (I made versions of my IRL pedal boards)

    -   MIDI Effects
        -   Defaults for MIDI Effects
        -   Players (working on a pretty sweet tony wiliams simulator)
        -   Player states (Drunk)

-   [Racks](Racks/README.md) - A folder to hold rack units. Each of these folders are symlinked to their normal place two levels deep in `Presets` folder for quicker access. Those folders each hold a lot of presets and fuck digging around in there.
-   [Samples](Samples/README.md) - This is where you can store your whosampled 90s hip hop sources library.

## With love from Brent &lt;3

I sincerly hope that someone finds value in this and runs with it. Anyone who is interested in sharing their presets with me, gitize your library folder and send me a pull request. Let's create a massive, free open source resource library for all those to come after us.
