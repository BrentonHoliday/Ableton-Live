# Racks

The Racks folder provides a quick short cut to the three rack folders

-   `Presets/Audio Effects/Audio Effect Rack` - Since it's 3 levels deep and there there's 43 other folders in there, it makes sense to have a quick shortcut.
-   `Presets/MIDI Effects/MIDI Effect Rack`
-   `Presets/Instruments/Instrument Rack`

There's symlinks to these three folders in their default locations.
